ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jyothsna
With over 10 years of experience in software development, I've worked across a range of environments â€” from nimble startups to large-scale corporate teams. Along the way, Iâ€™ve been involved in every phase of the development lifecycle, from cross-team communication and planning to hands-on coding, deployment, and post-release support.

As a full stack developer, I focus on building clean, efficient applications using Angular for dynamic front-end development and Node.js for backend APIs within microservices architectures. Iâ€™ve taken the lead on developing and maintaining UI components, designing scalable backend services, and managing CI/CD pipelines in agile settings.

Iâ€™m a self-learner by nature and comfortable working independently, but I also value collaboration and have played an active role in agile teams â€” guiding code reviews, sharing knowledge, and driving best practices. Whether itâ€™s solving a tricky bug, improving a user experience, or deploying to production, Iâ€™m always focused on delivering solid, reliable solutions.
